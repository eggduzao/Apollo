# apollo-lazy

`apollo-lazy` serves as the lazy query engine for the [Apollo](https://crates.io/crates/apollo)
DataFrame library. It allows you to perform operations on DataFrames in a lazy manner, only
executing them when necessary. This can lead to significant performance improvements for large
datasets.

**Important Note**: This crate is **not intended for external usage**. Please refer to the main
[Apollo crate](https://crates.io/crates/apollo) for intended usage.
