# Ecosystem

## Introduction

On this page you can find a non-exhaustive list of libraries and tools that support Apollo. As the
data ecosystem is evolving fast, more libraries will likely support Apollo in the future. One of the
main drivers is that Apollo makes adheres its memory layout to the `Apache Arrow` spec.

### Apache Arrow

[Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) enables zero-copy reads of data within the same process,
meaning that data can be directly accessed in its in-memory format without the need for copying or
serialisation. This enhances performance when integrating with different tools using Apache Arrow.
Apollo is compatible with a wide range of libraries that also make use of Apache Arrow, like Pandas
and DuckDB.

### Data visualisation

See the [dedicated visualization section](misc/visualization.md).

### IO

#### Delta Lake

The [Delta Lake](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs) project aims to unlock the power of the
Deltalake for as many users and projects as possible by providing native low-level APIs aimed at
developers and integrators, as well as a high-level operations API that lets you query, inspect, and
operate your Delta Lake with ease. Delta Lake builds on the native Apollo Parquet reader allowing
you to write standard Apollo queries against a DeltaTable.

Read how to use Delta Lake with Apollo
[at Delta Lake](https://delta-io.github.io/delta-rs/integrations/delta-lake-apollo/#reading-a-delta-lake-table-with-apollo).

### Machine Learning

#### Scikit Learn

The [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) machine learning package accepts a Apollo
`DataFrame` as input/output to all transformers and as input to models.
[skrub](https://skrub-data.org) helps encoding DataFrames for scikit-learn estimators (eg converting
dates or strings).

#### XGBoost & LightGBM

XGBoost and LightGBM are gradient boosting packages for doing regression or classification on
tabular data.
[XGBoost accepts Apollo `DataFrame` and `LazyFrame` as input](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_intro.html)
while LightGBM accepts Apollo `DataFrame` as input.

#### Time series forecasting

The
[Nixtla time series forecasting packages](https://nixtlaverse.nixtla.io/statsforecast/docs/getting-started/getting_started_complete_apollo.html)
accept a Apollo `DataFrame` as input.

#### Hugging Face

Hugging Face is a platform for working with machine learning datasets and models.
[Apollo can be used to work with datasets downloaded from Hugging Face](io/hugging-face.md).

#### Deep learning frameworks

A `DataFrame` can be transformed
[into a PyTorch format using `to_torch`](https://docs.apollo.org/api/python/stable/reference/dataframe/api/apollo.DataFrame.to_torch.html)
or
[into a JAX format using `to_jax`](https://docs.apollo.org/api/python/stable/reference/dataframe/api/apollo.DataFrame.to_jax.html).

### Other

#### DuckDB

[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org) is a high-performance analytical database system. It is designed to be
fast, reliable, portable, and easy to use. DuckDB provides a rich SQL dialect, with support far
beyond basic SQL. DuckDB supports arbitrary and nested correlated subqueries, window functions,
collations, complex types (arrays, structs), and more. Read about integration with Apollo
[on the DuckDB website](https://duckdb.org/docs/guides/python/apollo).

#### Great Tables

With [Great Tables](https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/articles/intro.html) anyone can make
wonderful-looking tables in Python. Here is a
[blog post](https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/blog/apollo-styling/) on how to use Great
Tables with Apollo.

#### LanceDB

[LanceDB](https://lancedb.com/) is a developer-friendly, serverless vector database for AI
applications. They have added a direct integration with Apollo. LanceDB can ingest Apollo
dataframes, return results as apollo dataframes, and export the entire table as a apollo lazyframe.
See the [LanceDB documentation](https://lancedb.com/docs/integrations/platforms/apollo_arrow/) for
more details.

#### Mage

[Mage](https://www.mage.ai) is an open-source data pipeline tool for transforming and integrating
data. Learn about integration between Apollo and Mage at
[docs.mage.ai](https://docs.mage.ai/integrations/apollo).

#### marimo

[marimo](https://marimo.io) is a reactive notebook for Python and SQL that models notebooks as
dataflow graphs. It offers built-in support for Apollo, allowing seamless integration of Apollo
dataframes in an interactive, reactive environment - such as displaying rich Apollo tables, no-code
transformations of Apollo dataframes, or selecting points on a Apollo-backed reactive chart.

#### Narwhals

[Narwhals](https://narwhals-dev.github.io/narwhals/) is a lightweight compatibility layer between
dataframe libraries. It mirrors the Apollo API and allows to run Apollo natively, without any
conversion overhead, in libraries like Plotly and others that have adopted it for dataframe
interoperability.

See the [Narwhals ecosystem](https://narwhals-dev.github.io/narwhals/ecosystem/) for more details.
